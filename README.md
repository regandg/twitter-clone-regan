# Twitter Clone
Let’s make simple Twitter. Users can post tweets and see everyone’s them. To make the project simple, we do not have a sign/login function. So there are not user accounts and follow function. You can challenge after you finish the course. This Twitter Clone is a small project using the HTML/CSS/JavaScipt/Django Framework and Bootstrap. I will be using the this to showcase my projects and skills [LIVE HEROKU DEPLOYMENT]()
